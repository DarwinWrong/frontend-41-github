            <h1>Cat</h1>
            <p>
                The cat (<em>Felis catus</em>) is a small carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species 
                in the family Felidae and often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from wild members 
                of the family. The cat is either a house cat, kept as a pet, or a feral cat, freely ranging and 
                avoiding human contact. A house cat is valued by humans for companionship and for its ability to 
                hunt rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.

                Cats are similar in anatomy to other felid species, with a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, 
                sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. They are predators who are most 
                active at dawn and dusk (<em>crepuscular</em>). Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in 
                frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals. Compared to humans, 
                they see better in the dark (they see in near total darkness) and have a greater sense of smell, 
                but poorer color vision. Despite being solitary hunters, cats are a social species. Cat communication 
                includes the use of vocalizations including meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and 
                grunting as well as cat-specific body language.
